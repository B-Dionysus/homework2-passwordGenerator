# Password Generator
User can choose from a variety of options to tailer their new password, including lowercase characters, uppercase characters, special characters, and numbers.
Depending on what the user chooses, the text field updates with the current password conditions.
When the user clicks on the Generate button, it generates an appropriate password, copies it to the clipboard, and alerts the user via a modal.
